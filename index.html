<b><h1> My Story </h1></b>

<p>
Self-driven, productive, and a meticulous planner, I am an astronomer-in-training and a sophomore at the University of Texas at Austin.
Creativity and building new and meaningful connections are the core ideas I value along with a passion for Physics, Astronomy, Technology,
and Scientific Communication.
</p>

<p>
I am actively involved in the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin through my participation in two research projects.
First, I am working with Dr. William M.J. Best on constraining the initial mass function (IMF) of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.
Second, I am working with Zachary Vanderbosch as part of the Freshman Research Initiative to identify and analyze variable stars in
archival LCOGT data. These projects have been instrumental in developing my research interests in the field of brown dwarfs and in
time-domain astronomy.
</p>

<p>
I work as the Tutor Coordinator in the College Readiness Program, acting as the face of the College of Natural Sciences at UT Austin
for incoming students. I guide them through the process of preparing themselves to succeed in the Longhorn community, serving as their
go-to support, especially during the present COVID-19 pandemic. Further, I manage and work closely with a team of dedicated tutors,
aiding students in their preparation for the UT Math Assessment.
</p>

<p>
I am interested in participating in projects related to Physics and Astronomy to explore and diversify my research interests
as well as honing and expanding my current skill set. Feel free to reach out and I would be happy to connect!
