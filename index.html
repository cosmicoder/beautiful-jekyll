<center><b><h1> Welcome! </h1></b></center>

<p>
My name is Aniket Sanghi (he/him/his) and I am an astronomer-in-training and sophomore at the University of Texas at Austin.
Self-driven, productive, and a meticulous planner, I am driven by my passion for Physics, Astronomy, Technology,
and Scientific Communication. I seek to earn a Ph.D. in Astronomy and aim to to lead the scientific priorities of the next generation of 
telescopes by designing, proposing, and conducting large-scale, high-impact research programs and surveys, to push the boundaries of science that the astronomical community 
can accomplish. I strongly value creativity, building meaningful connections, and the role of inclusive mentorship in personal growth.

<p>
I am actively involved in the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin through my participation in three research projects.
First, I am working with Dr. Yifan Zhou and Dr. Brendan Bowler on reference star differential imaging of the PDS70 planetary system using HST/WFC3 images.
Second, I am working with Dr. William M.J. Best on constraining the initial mass function (IMF) of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.
Third, I am working with Dr. Michael H. Montgomery and Zachary Vanderbosch to identify and analyze variable stars and eclipsing systems in
archival LCO photometric data. These projects have been instrumental in developing my research interests in the field of brown dwarfs and in
time-domain astronomy.

<p>
I am interested in participating in projects related to Physics and Astronomy to explore and diversify my research interests
as well as honing and expanding my current skill set. Feel free to reach out and I would be happy to connect!
