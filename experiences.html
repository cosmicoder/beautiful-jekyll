<h2>PSLV C-42 Launch</h2>
<h5>Satish Dhawan Space Center - Sriharikota, India</h5>
</b>

<p>
I was selected as one of 2 students who had the rare opportunity to witness the successful launch of the Indian Space Research
Organization's (ISRO's) PSLV C-42 Mission from the Master Control Center at the Satish Dhawan Space Center, Sriharikota, India
in the presence of ISRO Directors and Chairmen such as Dr. K Sivan, Dr. S. Somanath, S. Pandian, Dr. V Narayanan, Shri AS Kiran Kumar,
Dr. P Radhakrishnan, R Hutton, MC Dathan, Shri EK Kutty and many more incredible people. I learned a lot about ISRO and its culture
from my interactions with Dr. P Radhakrishnan. This was one of the most memorable and unique experiences I have had till date.
You can discover every nuance of my journey in <a href="https://thecosmicaddress.wordpress.com/2018/09/21/lift-off/">this</a> dedicated blog post.

  <h2>CMS Experiment & SM-18 Test Facility</h2>
  <h5>CERN - Geneva, Switzerland</h5>
</b>

<p>
My passion for STEM took me to the heart of experimental physics - CERN - for a week-long student training and development programme
through Life Labs, New Delhi. I learned from the forerunners in Particle Physics, Dark Matter Research, Engineering Physics,
Quantum Physics, and Cosmology and gained a unique perspective on their personal experiences – from their daily routine at the LHC
to how they reacted and helped contain the 2008 explosion – a component of learning invaluable to me.
</p>

<p>
My curiosity feasted on the technicalities of the biggest machine built by mankind. Dr John Ellis, with his captivating humor,
brought the Standard Model to life, while Piotr Traczyk turned us, trainees, into true experimentalists as we undertook the task of
identifying the 126.7 GeV bump in the unrefined mass spectrum that led to the first detection of the God Particle. An insightful
underground visit to the CMS experiment at CERN, where we learned a little about the systems that gather collision data, a informative
tour of the SM-18 Test Facility, where we learned about superconducting magnets, as well as our attempts to build a working cloud chamber
brought to light the limitations associated with practical work – something I had taken for granted.
</p>

<p>
Every evening we would explore the city of Geneva on foot, visit the UN, try out the different restaurants at Gare Cornavin, and
travel around by the tram - sometimes to the old city to marvel at the architecture. We even had a city-wide treasure hunt!
Our trip ended with a short tour of Chamonix in France, as well as a visit to the icy Mer de Glace.
